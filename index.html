          <p>3.1. Alison’s Privacy and Data Protection Policy is publicly available on the Alison website and gives complete details on how Alison meets its obligations to registered learners. </p>

          <p>3.1.1. You as the User agree to be bound by the Privacy and Data Protection Policy. </p>
            
          <p>3.1.2. Individual User learner records will remain on the Alison platform unless the User explicitly closes their Alison account and requests your personal account data to be deleted. </p>

          <p>3.2.1. Access to the Alison platform is strictly controlled and Alison shall ensure that security measures shall be no less rigorous than accepted industry practices with respect to Data Security. </p>
            
          <p>3.2.2. If the User discovers a suspected security breach on their account the User must change their password immediately and contact Alison customer support immediately to facilitate investigation and minimise the impact of any breach. </p>

          <h4>4. Alison offers optional paid-for services including non-transferable Certificates as individual proof of study (both for certificate courses and diploma courses), other merchandise as well as a monthly renewable premium service that excludes advertising. </h4>
          <p> 4.1. The Premium ad-free subscription will be enabled for a specific term as defined in the shopping basket depending on the option chosen by the User, typically for one month, one year, or a perpetual term that doesn’t end. The ad-free experience will be made available on the User account immediately upon payment validation of the relevant fee. </p>

<p>4.1.1. The monthly and yearly subscription shall renew automatically at the end of each term unless cancelled.  
</p>
<p>4.1.2. The subscription disables all advertising from the Alison platform and may include additional bonus features from time to time, including a discount voucher on purchases (currently equal to 10% discount) of Certificates or merchandise. Discount vouchers do not expire and will last beyond the termination of the Premium subscription at Alison’s discretion.  One discount voucher code will be issued to the User account each month.  Unspent monthly discount vouchers can be accumulated over time. No more than 5 vouchers representing a 50% reduction can be applied to a single product purchase. Users can also spread accumulated monthly discounts across multiple products (e.g. 10% off each of 5 different products) on the same purchase event. Bonus features are subject to change without notice.   
</p>
<p>4.1.3. The User can cancel at any time through their User Account.  </p>

<p>4.1.4. The recurring fees will be subject to foreign exchange rate variation over time. Alison reserves the right to change the amount of subscription fee from time to time and to vary fees across different jurisdictions. Any changes to a User’s subscription fee will be communicated at least 30 days in advance of a renewal. </p>

<p>4.2. Purchased Certificates can be in multiple formats including digital pdf sent electronically, physical paper parchment that is sent by post (with an option to have the parchment set in a black wooden picture frame). Each Certificate purchase includes an Academic Transcript. This is a more detailed summary of the course you have completed on Alison and contains your personal details, the final score you achieved, a course description and the Module names that you have completed within the course. It also contains an authentication link you can share to validate your achievement.   </p>

<p>4.2.1. Digital Certificates can be downloaded directly from the User account dashboard after payment is finalised. </p>

<p>4.2.2. Parchment is printed on special paper containing security features such as embossed fibers, a 'genuine' metallic strip, the User’s details, and an Alison stamp. </p>

<p>4.2.3. The design, look and feel of the Certificates is subject to change from time to time, and is available to preview in the Alison Shop prior to and during the purchase process. Once a User makes a purchase you accept the Certificate as is. </p>

<p>4.3. Only Standard shipping is available in the shopping cart for your physical purchases and the delivery time will depend on where in the world the User’s delivery address is. Please allow up to 28 days for Standard shipping as this goes via national postal services. </p>

<p>4.4. User product returns and refund requests should be made to the Alison Customer Service team via email. The team will respond by email and will confirm any successful requests. Alison reserves the right to refuse a refund if not satisfied with the circumstances of the request.   </p>

<p>4.4.1. Any digital Certificates that have not been downloaded from the Alison platform can be cancelled and a refund will be provided. If the platform shows that the digital Certificate has been downloaded then no refund will be possible. If you have problems downloading digital Certificates please get in touch with the Customer Support team. </p>


<p>4.4.2. If a physical product has not yet been printed and shipped it will be cancelled and Alison will make a full refund. If a physical product has already shipped then the User must return the product(s) and then Alison will make a partial refund minus the original shipping fee incurred. If the User produces evidence to show that a product has been lost and undelivered within the expected maximum timeframe, Alison reserves the right to either resend the product(s) or make a full refund at its discretion.  </p>

<p>4.4.3. If a User has pre-ordered Certificates prior to completing a course, the User can cancel unredeemed Certificates and a refund will be provided. Any redeemed Certificates will not be refunded. </p>

<p>4.4.4. If a User cancels their Premium subscription prior to the end of their term, any unspent ad-free subscription time will remain in place in the case of a monthly subscription. No refunds will be available for unspent time on a monthly subscription. For annual terms, unspent time will be refunded with an adjustment of the fee on the basis of a conversion of the fee from an annual to a monthly subscription. Alison will immediately notify the User of unspent time that will remain on the account and the refund amount when the Premium subscription is cancelled. </p>
          
          <h4>5. Alison offers a “Referral Reward” as an incentive to existing registered Users to refer friends to register on the Alison platform. Users and their referrals agree to the following additional terms: </h4>
          <p>
            5.1. Alison will provide the User with a unique referral link which should be used to invite a friend (a “Referee”). The User is free to share this link among friends or through social media as long as they do not exhibit harrassing behaviour. </p>

<p>5.2. For a Referring User to qualify for a reward, both the referrer and the referee must be registered Alison Users.  The Referee must not already have been a registered Alison User. At least three (3) Referees from the unique referral link must register AND complete an Alison course within 30 days of their respective registrations.  </p>

<p>5.3. The Referring User can monitor the progress of their referral(s) and any Referral Award through their own User account dashboard.  </p>

<p>5.4. More than one Referral Award may be granted to Referring User. The Referral Award is a 50% discount voucher on the cost of a Certificate purchase for a triplicate of referrals that purchase.

The Referral Award cannot be substituted for cash and cannot be combined with any other Alison offer. </p>

<p>5.5. Any suspected self-referrals or other fraudulent activity identified by Alison’s automated analytics will automatically disqualify the identified Users from participating in the Referral Rewards. Alison has absolute discretion in determining if a User that exhibits questionable behaviour should be removed from the Referral Reward programme. </p>

<p>5.6. Alison reserves the right to change, suspend or cancel the Referral Reward programme at any time without notice. </p>

          <h4>7. Any product name, brand or logo trademarks belonging to third parties are not affiliated with Alison and are not endorsed, sponsored or connected in any way unless explicitly stated otherwise.  </h4>
          <h4>8. Opinions and views expressed by Publishers or Users on the Alison platform and social media are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of Alison.</h4>
          <p>8.1.

          <h4>9. Both Alison and you the User are expected to abide by these terms of use and comply with applicable laws and government regulations. </h4>
  <p> 9.1.
